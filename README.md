# Pico y placa predictor
## Task:
Using the language that you feel most proficient in, weâ€™d like you to write a "Pico y Placa" predictor. The inputs should be a license plate number (the full number, not the last digit), a date (as a String), and a time, and the program will return whether or not that car can be on the road. You may use any input and output method you prefer. To develop this application you need to consider the past rules of the Pico&Placa. (Hours: 7:00am - 9:30am / 16:00pm - 19:30)

## To run the project:
-git clone 
-cd picoyplaca
-python3 -m venv env  
-pip install -r requirements 
-python manage.py runserver
